# ⚠️
This was a weather dashboard that I built during my coding bootcamp using HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript. 
It looked rough though, so I decided to rebuild it using reactjs and bootstrap. I'm planning to turn it into a mobile-first react app, so I can easily check the weather anytime without ANY ads 😭

This is a weather dashboard app that allows a user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. 
It features the OpenWeather One Call API, jQuery, Bootstrap, dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and persistent data stored in localStorage.
